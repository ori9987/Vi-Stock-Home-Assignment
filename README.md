# Stock Pricing Data Analysis

## Assignment Overview

This project involves analyzing stock pricing data to understand its structure and quality. The primary goal is to assess the data's integrity, identify key features, and perform necessary transformations. The process is documented to ensure clarity and reproducibility for reviewers.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Understanding the Data

To begin, I loaded the stock pricing data to get an overview of its structure. The initial inspection included:
- Checking the number of rows and columns.
- Identifying any duplicates or missing values.
- Extracting key features such as the number of unique tickers and the date range of the data.

### 2. Initial Data Inspection

- **Number of Rows:** 1245
- **Number of Columns:** 7
- **Columns:** date, open, high, low, close, volume, ticker
- **Duplicates:** 0
- **Missing Values:** None
- **Number of Unique Tickers:** 5
- **Date Range:** From November 9, 2015 to November 2, 2016

### 3. Key Features Identified

The unique tickers identified in the dataset are:
1. AAPL
2. GOOG
3. BLK
4. MSFT
5. TSLA

### 4. Data Transformation

Given the relatively simple nature of this dataset, initial transformations include:
- Converting the `date` column to a datetime format for easier manipulation and analysis.
- Any additional transformations required for more complex analyses.

### 5. Structuring the Project

For complex projects, I prefer to encapsulate my functions within a class structure. This approach allows for better organization and modularity. By importing relevant data into the class, any changes can be managed in a centralized manner, enhancing maintainability.

### 6. Deployment

The final step involves deploying the transformation logic to the cloud. This ensures that the data is accessible and can be processed efficiently in a scalable environment.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, I ensure a thorough understanding of the data before performing any transformations. This structured approach not only helps in maintaining data integrity but also makes the process transparent and reproducible for reviewers.
